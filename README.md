# hello-world
beginner repository

Hello all, my name is Stone Darrow a current computer science major at Monmouth College in Illinois.
I see that Hubot ate tacos from the moon and I was wondering if that means the github team made it to the dark side of the moon? 
If so you guys should probably report that, because nobody else has ever been there.
